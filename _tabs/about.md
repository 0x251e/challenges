I'm a passionate CTF player who enjoys digging into challenging challenges to hone my cybersecurity abilities. My approach to learning include not just overcoming current difficulties, but also inventing my own, which allows me to thoroughly investigate numerous cybersecurity issues. Here, you'll discover a collection of the challenges I've created, step-by-step instructions for creating your own, and thorough answers to help you learn and improve in this subject.

If you're seeking for new challenges or want to collaborate on making them, please contact me on Discord or via [email](mailto:shreethaara380@gmail.com).
