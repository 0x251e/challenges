## Description: 

I love fish, and my place is full of them. One day, my neighbor knocked and said, "There's an aquarium with 100 goldfishes in it and it has a nick-name of a movie character." She gave me a movie poster of that character and left. That's all she knew and now I am stuck figure it out. Can you help to find out where exactly this aquarium locates ?
